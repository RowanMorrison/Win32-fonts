Face down and fucked again
Face down and fucked again
Taste of blood again
Know that you three
Were the last thing that I've seen

| Trying To Explain Lyrics

I was trying to talk to you
But you couldn't hear
And I was trying to explain to you
But you wouldn't listen
And when I wrote it down
You couldn't see what was written

| The Guilty Party

And thanks for branding me a failure
And for destroying what joy I had
The mantles cracked
And turning black
I found out I'm not the man
That I fucking think I am

And you're just like a fucking ghostie
You trouble me when I try to sleep
The sombre way
You held your face
And we can never erase
All the stupid things we say

And I hope that you're dreaming of me
The way I'm forced to dream of you
And so you've won
I'll get the gun
'Cause we can never undo
All the stupid things we've done

| What's Wrong

Flowers for you yet again
And the tear stained cheeks never end

We only seem to respond in kind
Where an eye for an eye only leaves us blind

We only seem to respond in kind
An eye for an eye only leaves us blind
We only seem to respond in kind
An eye for an eye only leaves us blind

We only seem to respond in kind
Where an eye for an eye only leaves us blind

We only seem to respond in kind
An eye for an eye only leaves us blind
We only seem to respond in kind
An eye for an eye only leaves us blind

Flowers for you yet again
And the tear stained cheeks never end

We only seem to respond in kind
Where an eye for an eye only leaves us blind

We only seem to respond in kind
Where an eye for an eye only leaves us blind
We only seem to respond in kind
Where an eye for an eye only leaves us blind

| The Kursk

It's cold I'm afraid
It's been like this for a day
The water is rising and slowly we're dying
We won't see a light again

We won't see our wives again

It's cold I'm afraid
It's been like this for a day
The water is rising and slowly we're dying
We won't see a light again

We won't see our wives again

It's cold I'm afraid
It's been like this for a day
The water is rising and slowly we're dying
We won't see a light again

We won't see our wives again



It's cold I'm afraid
It's been like this for a day
The water is rising and slowly we're dying
We won't see a light again

We won't see our wives again

It's cold I'm afraid
It's been like this for a day
The water is rising and slowly we're dying
We won't see a light again

We won't see our wives again

| What The Fuck Am I Doing On This Battlfield?

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

It will always hurt

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

And so say all of us

It will always hurt
And so say all of us

| A Waste Of Blood

And the craters remain from the last time you came
And seemingly our only crime was wrong place, wrong time

And that's why we died

Decisions were made by some corporate ingrates
Put a price on all of our lives, happens all the time

And that's why we died
And that's why we died
And that's why we died
And that's why we died
And that's why we died
And that's why we died

That's why we died

|| Howling Songs

| The KÃ¼bler-Ross Model

When solace finds you
Knock at my door
We'll talk till dawn
We'll cherish this time
Not like before
And woe betide those who decry you
They'll never know how I adore you

Your face was pale and turned away
It must have hurt to go that way
The gasp you made, your last refrain
More shock than pain, could not explain
But in your eyes, something to say
I'll have to wait, until my...

Day starts with a tear, always sat alone
All goes for a reason?
Or no? Please let me know
My fallen friend, I've failed you again, again

It's two knocks for yes & just one knock for no
All goes for a reason?
Or no? Knock let me know
I'd do anything, just to hear your voice again

No one knows what happened when you died
And that's the reason why the loved ones cried
No one knows if you're in heaven
Or if dead was the end
No one knows if you'll be back again

And if someone says they know then it's a lie
You can only judge what's seen with your two eyes
Can't say if this thing that sits behind these fevered eyes
Will one day sit behind another's eyes

And there was only as much joy as there was pain
Which made an ultimately empty game
But sometimes in the dead of night a voice whispers my name
Maybe it speaks from another plane
Or maybe it's a sign that I'm insane

| Something About Ghosts

I'm as lonely as a ghost
As I sit down to write these notes
To you and your intended
Spring is the worst time for most
Who'll never know the boundaries
Or heard the notes as they were sung

I believe this lonely ghost was forced to wander on
Until by chance or fate was summoned to call on you
A service that he knew wouldn't be answered
Less repaid in lust

Still your jaded shadow was forced to look upon
Sights not even a ghost should have to see
And as he slumps so listed, he cannot bear to watch
And yet he cannot draw his gaze away and flee

This poor ghost can only howl
Although his howls cannot be heard
His cries will go unheeded
No one will ever read his words
And though he cannot weep
He sheds his tears through me

| How Much in Blood

How much in blood?
How much in gold?
What volume of tears will suffice?
What is the index price of life?
And did it fall or rise today?

That's why I dream with a gun in my hand
And that dreams particularly clear
I dream of the day that we'll laugh at your name
And laugh at all you held dear
We'll sing of the days lost to labor and waste
We'll laugh at the days ruled by fear
We'll laugh at your name
We'll dance on your grave
And we'll laugh at all you held dear

Prices will fall
The markets will stall
Your ways will be forced to the fore
We'll laugh at your name
And dance on your grave
And laugh at all you held dear

| A Broken Flamenco

When faced with a fall
We'll always flinch
What use reacting to a chasm so deep
We'd much rather sleep

When faced with a flame
We'll turn our face
What use recoiling from an infernal rage
We'll burn as we wait

| Berlin and Bisenthal

Why can't you hear my calling?
I am perpetually mourning
Can't seem to stop myself from falling
It always comes without a warning

It's cold against this window
I never know which way the wind blows
I watch the trees but they don't show me
I sit alone amongst the debris

| I Name This Ship the Tragedy, Bless Her and All Who Sail with Her

Love we made
Between pissing
And even as we sail
This boat is listing
We've weathered storms
Without even thinking
That even as we speak
This ship is sinking

Our die was cast in better days
But the compass points are all erased
And so we're forced to drift for days
Looks like this ship is lost again

Anchors ripped
These sails are tearing
And there is no clear way
To see how we're fairing
Only the stars
To check our bearings
And our witch's marks
To bless our pairing

We'll batten down beneath the waves
And talk and laugh and lust for days
Even Saint Nick would turn his face
This fucking ship is lost again

We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours
We'll sail on, again
It's ours

| The Howling Song

Howl
It's hard
And that's why I howl
It's the only thing that's left
And that's why I howl
It's the only thing that's left

| Bomb the Stock Exchange

When you wake up with tears in your face
Can't make the voice go away
Can't take the pain, it's easier to go insane
Than to study yourself wane

When all of your memories are sad
Forgotten the dreams that you had
Friends are a lie, that don't care if you live or die
What to do but cry?

When you can't stand the light when you wake
You're reliving the same old mistake
Just to escape the fear, you get fucked on your choice of gear
It's the only choice round here

If you'll top yourself anyway
Why not bomb the stock exchange?

|| Failing Songs

| Our Weight In Oil

And the world was lost some years ago
When the tyrants upped & seized control
And we lost our lives to worthless toil
And we're worth less than our weight in oil

But the stockholders all had their pay
But it's we who clean their mess anyway
And that revolution never came
And we'll never see that chance again

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know
And hurt is all we know

| Chains

We're free to do exactly what we're told
We're free to buy what we're sold
We're nothing more than slaves my dear
But our chains are made of gold

We're slaves, we're slaves, we're slaves
We're slaves, we're slaves, we're slaves

Though our chains are golden
They're still just fucking chains

We're free to do exactly what we're told
We're free to buy what we're sold
We're nothing more than slaves my dear
But our chains are made of gold
We're slaves, we're slaves, we're slaves
We're slaves, we're slaves, we're slaves
Though our chains are golden
They're still just fucking chains

| The Failing Song

As youths we used to talk at night
Of the joys that life was going to bring our way
And the failures of our forebears
Were as clear to us as the cold light of day
But now those days are dead & gone
And the future that we had is now the past
And it's cobwebs that we cling to
Our aspirations turned to ashes in our hands

| Broken Bones

We as beasts of burden take the fall
Though they'll break our backs, won't share the spoils
Time to put some backs against the wall
Best to stand and die than live and crawl

Though they'll break our bones, they'll break our bones
Though they'll smash our homes, they'll smash our homes
There's a special place in hell reserved for them

We as beasts of burden take the fall
Though they'll break our backs, won't share the spoils
Time to put some backs against the wall
Best to stand and die than live & crawl

Our hands are forced
Against the hordes
Who heard is this all that we're put here for
Just to hoard
Just to hoard

| Desamparado

Head in sand
My head in your hands
Stolen time is all we'll find
We'll never see that peace of mind
I will break and you will bend
It never ends
It never ends

| Lone Gunman Required

Here we stand alone again
Divided by the same old men
Hands behind our backs again
And our backs against the wall again

Excuse us if we take offense
Each action has a consequence
And yours cause nothing but laments
And our backs against the wall again

I pray our pain will be your pain
As you use and hold us back again
And profit from our loss again
Until the straw that breaks this camel's chains

Some day soon the time will come
To rid the world of greedy scum
When that day come, I'll get my gun
You'll be the first against the wall my friend

| Good Pawn

One more day
And we're on our way
And like all good pawns
We'll sing
As we fall

Honor and pride
And a soldier's life
It's easy to kill
With god
On your side

Our way of life
Is for what we strive
And we'll see our goal
No matter
How many die
One more day
And we're on our way
And like all good pawns
We'll sing
As we fall

| Compassion Fatigue

Let's just go through this one more time
Can't quite see that look in your eyes
Or hear the cries
I'll feign surprise
Like every time we always
Run through
This shit
Over again

Let's just go through this one more time
I've nothing better to do with this life
Than this endless strife
The endless cries
All contrived
You're talking
Endless
Talking
Saying
Nothing

| Gone

Face full of sun
And we run
'til we lose our way

Bad thoughts are gone
War is won
And all's in its place

The day's all ours
Until we
Trip on a grave

Birds stop their song
As you turn
To me and say

We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone
We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone

We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone
We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone

We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone
We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone

We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone
We will be gone, we will be gone
We will be gone
